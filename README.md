# Find Your Tutor


This project gives students the ability to set their preferences for tutors regarding their availability, salary, and location. It can also be something of a joy to people who are looking to try their hands on part-time teaching.


This project uses Flask for developing the web-application along with Python for the backend coding and MySQL database for storing the data. It also uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS in the frontend along with the Bootstrap framework.
